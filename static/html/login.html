            <h3> Test your Encryption </h3 >
            Enter your username, password and encryption key. (Dont tick overwrite)<br/>
            This will attempt to retrieve your encrypted private data and decrypt.<br/>
            If you make it past the login page, that means your data was successfully decrypted.<br/>
            If you receive invalid username or password, This could be invalid credentials<br/>
            or something else went wrong. Either try again or contact me.<br/>
            As an extra check, call the list users api. If you are on there, it was successful.<br/>
        <p>
            <h3> Test your Decryption </h3 >
            <h4>Note: </h4>
            Due to not having access to your existing private keys, this will:<br/>
            <ul>
                <li>Overwrite your existing private data.</li>
                <li>Create a new public private key for you.(and add it to your account)</li>
                <li>Set your "incoming key" to this new key</li>
            </ul><br/>
            To use one of your old keys, you will need to call the report api with that key<br/>
            (to reset it as your incoming key).<br/>
            Use this to add new encrypted private data to your account to check your decryption against.<br/>
            If you get past the login page, this means your new private data has been added.<br/>
            If you receive invalid username or password, This could be invalid credentials<br/>
            or something else went wrong. Either try again or contact me.<br/>
            As an extra check, call the list users api. If you are on there, it was successful.<br/>
